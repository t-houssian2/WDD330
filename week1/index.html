    <h1>Week 1</h1>
    <p>This week I was refeshed on many concepts including how to do basic things in html
        and javascript. I was refreshed on the forEach function as I was creating my
        table of contents and how to create and access elements in javascript. I also
        learned a lot about mobile first development and found some flaws
        in my previous designs.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>- Mobile first is a must</li>
        <li>- Mobile first is not desktop design than fit to mobile</li>
        <li>- Mobile is here to stay, start at the smallest and least technical</li>
        <li>- Remember media queries</li>
        <li>- Start with min width and build up</li>
    </ul>
